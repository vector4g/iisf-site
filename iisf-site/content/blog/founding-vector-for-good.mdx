# Founding Vector for Good

The seed for Vector for Good was not planted in a computer science lab, but during 20 years of service as a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman (HM1).

Serving through the entirety of the "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" era (1993–2011), Founder Levi Hankins lived the reality of institutional invisibility. While officially protected by policy, the lived reality was starkly different: to be fully visible was to be unsafe.

> “For 20 years, I navigated a system designed for people who could be fully visible. When you're forced to hide who you are to stay safe, you develop a visceral understanding of the gap between official policy (‘everyone is protected’) and lived reality (‘people like me fall through the cracks’). That gap is what Vector for Good exists to close—not just for LGBTQ+ service members, but for every marginalized community navigating systems built without them in mind.”

This experience—combined with treating TBI, PTSD, and sensory trauma in combat zones—revealed a critical market failure: legacy safety systems are built for the “standard” user. They fail catastrophically for the neurodivergent, the disabled, and the LGBTQ+ traveler.

Vector for Good exists to transform that lived invisibility into intersectional intelligence.
